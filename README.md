# Welcome to the Praktikum Umweltbiologie - Ecological Genetics

Here is the `R` [tutorial](https://github.com/scrameri/Umweltbiologie/blob/master/Tutorials.ipynb) for the practical, implemented as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). To start the interactive session, klick on the link [open in collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/scrameri/Umweltbiologie/blob/master/Tutorials.ipynb).

It briefly introduces the following topics:
* reading data
* data exploration using various plots
* use of regular expressions
* reproducibility in science
* statistical distributions
* analysis of variance and linear models
* model diagnostics (residual analysis)
* model comparison

It is my no means complete, but aims at giving an overview and introduction for the course, where students should learn to design research questions and scientific experiments, carry out as well as analyze and communicate the results of these experiments.

If you have any questions, suggestions or comments, do not hesitate to ask [me](mailto:simon.crameri@env.ethz.ch).
