# Welcome to the Praktikum Umweltbiologie - Ecological Genetics

Here is the `R` [tutorial](https://github.com/scrameri/Umweltbiologie/blob/master/Tutorials.ipynb) for the practical, implemented as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). To start the interactive session, klick on the link *open in collab*.

It (briefly) covers the following topics:

* data exploration using various plots
* use of regular expressions
* reproducibility in science
* statistical distributions
* analysis of variance and linear models
