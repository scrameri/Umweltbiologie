# Welcome to the Praktikum Umweltbiologie - Ecological Genetics

Here is the `R` [tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scrameri/Umweltbiologie/master/Tutorials.ipynb) for the practical, implemented as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

It (briefly) covers the following topics:
* reading data
* data exploration using various plots
* use of regular expressions
* reproducibility in science
* statistical distributions
* analysis of variance and linear models
